The holiday season is the time of year when we're all busy buying gifts, baking goodies, decorating our homes and making arrangements to be with family and friends.	3.3
Many of the children are victims of abuse or live in unstable homes.	2.33

The Iraqi government has agreed to let U.S. Rep. Tony Hall visit the country next week to assess a humanitarian crisis that has festered since the Gulf War of 1990, Hall's office said Monday.	2.9
The Iraqi government blames the embargo for the malnutrition, infant mortality and other hardships.	2.6
Hall, an Ohio Democrat and one of very few U.S. congressmen to visit Iraq since the 1991 Gulf War over Kuwait, is scheduled to embark Sunday the 12-hour overland trip to the Iraqi capital, Baghdad.	2.86
If supplies are not reaching the people who need them, Hall said, he wanted to find out whether the United Nations or relief agencies needed to handle things differently, or whether "Iraq needs to get out of the way and let us do the job."	2.7
Iraq says the United States and Britain hold up delivery of needed supplies, using their clout in the United Nations.	2.57
"It was very, very important" to compel Iraq to rid itself of weapons of mass destruction so that "it cannot use or export them to other countries," he told Associated Press Television News.	2.87
But he insisted the international community can do a much better job in helping Iraq deal with its economic and health problems.	3.0

"There was death in D.C. throughout the '80s and into the '90s, and there was death everywhere," said Starke, who was reared in New Rochelle, N.Y., and played at Columbia.	2.3
"It wasn't like New York's or Boston's organized crime. It was kids shooting kids. It was a 14-year-old from R Street who got his crew of six together and ran their drug block killing another 14-year-old and his crew from a block away. And from the beginning I could see that it was all about jobs. I could see that you needed the private sector involved."	2.14

The 1933 double eagle, a $20 gold piece with a mysterious history that involves a president, a king and a Secret Service sting operation, was auctioned Tuesday last night for a record price for a coin, $7.59 million, nearly double the previous record.	3.3
"suggests that the marketplace for important items is enormously strong,"	3.3
Sotheby's partner in the one-lot auction was Stack's Rare Coins, with which it shared the customary 15 percent commission.	3.2
"This is the Mona Lisa of coins,"	3.0
"So the auction was almost like the ribbon-cutting ceremony for the convention,"	3.0
Torricelli also insisted that he had not done any unusual favors for Chang, who first turned to the senator in 1995 for help in winning the repayment of some $71 million he said he was then owed in a failed business deal with the North Korean government.	3.0
"Many people believe that our great coin rarities are vastly undervalued in comparison to old master paintings,"	3.2
Your acceptance on loan from Mr. Chang of bronze statues (eagle and bronco buster) for display in your Senate office under your office's policy of accepting the loan of home state artwork was not consistent with Senate rules governing such loans, evidenced poor judgment, displayed a lack of due regard for the Senate rules and resulted in a violation of the Senate Gifts Rule (35) and, consequently, a violation of your public disclosure obligations under Senate rules.	2.6
In its letter, which was signed by all six members, the panel wrote that it was "troubled by incongruities, inconsistencies and conflicts, particularly concerning actions taken by you which were or could have been of potential benefit to Chang."	2.91
Your failure to act to prevent the acceptance of or to pay for gifts of earrings from Mr. Chang to individuals (your sister, an employee and a friend) in your home at Christmas on the mistaken belief that such items were of little value or were not gifts to you under the circumstances, evidenced poor judgment, displayed a lack of due regard for Senate rules and resulted in a violation of the Senate Gifts Rule (35) and, consequently, a violation of your public disclosure obligations under Senate Rule 34.	2.67
The committee understands that you have previously delivered the bronze statues to the Department of Justice, from whence they should be returned to Chang.	3.3
The words "His resume is an American dream," a quotation from Time magazine, appear on the screen.	3.18
A series of snapshots and images are then a visual resume for McCall.	3.1
A photograph of the candidate standing in his Army uniform next to his mother is shown, then the advertisement shifts to McCall talking about education, while images of the candidate looking at a computer screen with a small child and of him surrounded by children appear.	3.0
On the basis of thousands of pages of information developed in an earlier federal inquiry into Torricelli's activities, the committee chastised him for using poor judgment and disregarding Senate rules in his dealings with the former donor, David Chang.	2.71
"Experience. Excellence. Carl McCall"	3.5
"Time Magazine called his life an American dream. Carl McCall, Army lieutenant, state senator, ambassador to the United Nations, school board president, Citibank vice president, and one of the most effective comptrollers in New York history."	3.1
"I grew up poor with a single mother. She said education's a sledgehammer. It can open doors to opportunity. That's what education did for me. As governor, I'll make sure that every kid in New York has the same opportunity I had, to get a good education."	3.4
He had the title of ambassador when he was at the United Nations, but he was not the chief of the American mission.	3.0
As for the claim about his success as comptroller, where he controls the state pension funds, there is no disputing the funds' growth during his terms, but some critics say it had more to do with the buoyancy of the stock market in the 1990s than skilled management.	3.0
During that time, the panel said, Torricelli and members of his Senate staff took a series of actions to help Chang, contacting U.S. government officials, writing letters to foreign government officials and bringing Chang or his business representatives into meetings with foreign officials.	3.1
The New Jersey Supreme Court on Tuesday overturned the death sentence of Leslie Ann Nelson, a transsexual go-go dancer who killed a police officer and an investigator with an AK-47 rifle.	2.5
Justice James R. Zazzali and Justice Virginia Long said in a separate opinion that in addition to the reasons given in the majority opinion, also written by Zazzali, they believed the death penalty would constitute cruel and unusual punishment because of Nelson's history of emotional disturbance.	2.8
The verdict should be annulled, not just on humanitarian grounds but because his prosecution is an abrogation of the most basic standards of justice.	2.6

That information included witness statements, store receipts and other documents indicating that Chang had paid for expensive items given to Torricelli, his sister, one of his longtime aides, Roberta Stern, and one of Torricelli's former girlfriends, Judy D. Balaban.	3.0
Nor did it cite a $1,590 Oriental carpet that Chang gave to Torricelli's former wife, Susan Holloway Torricelli.	2.88
"poor judgment"	2.4
Finally, the committee appeared to have discounted Torricelli's contention that he was not responsible for expensive earrings that Chang had given as Christmas gifts to his sister, Stern and Balaban.	3.1
"that such items were of little value or were not gifts to you under the circumstances"	2.9
The analysis, which was assembled from banking and credit records, income-tax returns and congressional financial-disclosure forms, showed by March of 1998, Torricelli's cash expenditures were more than $22,000 in excess of the cash he had generated from checks and automatic-teller machines, an official who has reviewed the document said.	3.0

Moore presents the most important part of the speech to back up this point and ignores the fluff.	3.1
To say that they could not have done otherwise is a bold lie by Moore's critics.	2.6
"Moore works by depriving you of context and guiding your mind to fill the vacuum -- with completely false ideas.	2.7
This is naive to the extreme -- Heston would not be president of the NRA if he was not kept up to date on the most prominent cases of gun violence.	2.6
a) Moore clearly states that "before he came to Flint", Heston gave an interview.	3.14
"we wanted to let the NRA know that we haven't forgotten about Kayla Rolland"	2.9
Why did Moore, the masterful deveiver, not edit this sequence out?	2.7
You accuse Moore so often of changing the chronology, yet you have no problems changing it yourself.	2.78
After the Flint rally comes a brief TV interview with Heston, where he is asked about Kayla Rolland (again, clear evidence that the local media in Flint raised questions about the NRA's presence), then an inteview with country prosecutor Arthur Busch, entirely ignored by critics of the film, who also mentions Heston's presence as notable, and refers to the immediate reactions of "people from all over America", gun owners/groups who, according to him, reacted aggressively to warnings of having guns accessible to children, much like spanking advocates react aggressively when anti-spankers point to a case of a child being killed or severely injured by a beating.	2.3
Perhaps the best example of the paranoia surrounding Moore's film is your sub-essay "Is the end of the Heston interview itself faked?	2.8
In poor areas, the highly profitable drug business obviously is often seen as the last resort.	2.5
Virtually every child psychologist knows that mother/child bonding is essential for the development of empathy and social abilities, the awareness of the consequences of one's actions, and the learning of conflict resolution by non-violent means.	3.11
Even the official quoted by Moore blames the welfare to work program, knowing full well that the drug issue is a red herring.	2.7
Never mind that the Taliban continued selling opium in spite of the deal.	2.86
Statistics are Moore's weakest point, and it is surprising that his critics don't dwell on them longer.	2.9
That's because they know all too well that Moore is correct: The United States have a far greater homicide rate (both gun- and non-gun) than most other first world countries.	2.5
Not surprisingly, guncite, too, compares data from different years -- as I know from personal experience, it is quite difficult to do comparisons of crime statistics due to differences in reporting frequency and methodology.	2.71
The gun control movement, on the other hand, distracts from the real causes of violence -- poverty, paranoia, the "war on drugs" and antisexuality.	3.0
He asks us to "look at what I, a foreign citizen, was able to do at a local Canadian Wal-Mart."	3.12
"That's right. I could buy as much ammunition as I wanted, in Canada.	3.3
If Moore simply chose not to show how he revealed his identification to the salesperson, there is nothing fraudulent about that.	3.0
11) Heston's allegedly implied racism.	2.71
Similarly, the main motivation for the crusades (beyond the promise of wealth) was that Christians were supposedly being slaughtered and had to be saved.	2.36
Heston's answers in the interview were evasive and unhelpful.	2.2
The most shameful part of the ongoing attacks against Moore is that these answers have been all but ignored by his critics.	2.5
Interactive fiction like video games, on the other hand, presents violence in a narrative context, which may very well desensitize participants to said violence, but no causative link has ever been proven.	2.9
But perhaps the campaign against Moore is really motivated by another reason.	3.0
His next project has the working title "Fahrenheit 9/11: The temperature at which freedom burns", and he intends to launch it shortly before the next US presidential election.	3.11
After all, the same kind of PR blitz was started against the previous record-holding documentary: "Roger & Me" by Michael Moore.	2.89
This text is in the public domain.	3.0
It is no more so than any other successful documentary of the last decades.	3.0
Critics have stated that this scene was "staged", but in the bank interview, the official tells Moore that the bank has its own vault storing about 500 weapons at any given time.	3.0
In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, linked from your site, an employee claims that the gun would have been "normally" picked up at another dealer.	3.0
This sounds more like a later correction for public relations purposes, but of course nobody questions the bank claims when they can be used against Moore.	2.75
The only thing that Moore compressed is the timeframe.	3.0
This is plausible -- but entirely irrelevant for the movie, which already makes it quite clear that a background check is being performed.	2.9
There is nothing inaccurate whatsoever about the bank scene.	3.0
This is perhaps the criticism repeated the most often, and it also the most inaccurate.	2.86
First, the actual quotes from the film are often reproduced incorrectly.	2.56
The dialogue goes as follows:	3.0
"I guess I don't see that specific connection because the missiles that you're talking about were built and designed to defend us from somebody else who would be aggressors against us."	2.6
Moore is not from Colorado -- his question is generic, not meant to refer specifically to the Lockheed Martin plant in question.	2.88
However, critics of Moore have cleverly ignored McCollum's response and presented Moore as spreading lies about the Lockheed plant.	2.7
It is typical for his critics to jump on what is at most a slightly misleading implication, but in doing so, they themselves have, unlike Moore, made many incorrect claims.	2.8
First, the "from my cold, dead hands" part: This is used by Moore as a visual citation to introduce Heston.	2.82
The "visual of a billboard and a narration" is viewed by you as evidence that Moore is trying to somehow tie the two events together, when in reality, it is quite obvious that he does it to separate the introduction of Heston from his speech in Denver.	2.83
I should know.	3.0
Just saying....it seems I have more life now then you have and we know how little I get out!	2.6
I don't remember if you've made noises here before about turning these into a book, but if you do you've got at least one reader.	3.3

If you have absolutely nothing better to do on a Friday night, feel free to scan through my 2009 archives and tell me what you think should be included in the "Best of" post.	3.0

He pitched for the Astros before he came to the Mets, stayed for '85, then he pitched for the Red Sox against the Mets in '86 World Series.	3.0
I remember him being ineffective, and as it turns out, he was .	2.7
Now that I remember him, which I didn't before, I remember him as being the pitcher who'd pitched for 1) the team the Mets faced to get to the '86 Series and 2) the one they faced in it.	3.0
But burned out toward the end.	2.6
Having given up on watching the actual sport, mention of baseball now only sparks memories of The Old Man and the Sea and the old time baseball writers.	3.1
Ants themselves rely primarily on chemical information taken in through their antennae, and to mimic this, Antie will have chemical sensing and emitting “stalks” with which to both interact with other ants (who may be surprised to find an ant without antennae) and take in chemical information.	3.0
Such a robot would allow for both long-term studies of ant-robot interactions and studies of task-switching in the robots.	3.25
Returning successful patrollers have an even greater effect on foraging activity: foragers will not leave the nest unless a patroller returns (Gordon, 2002), and the rate of foraging in a colony can be controlled by rolling glass beads coated with cuticular hydrocarbons extracted from patrollers into the nest (Gordon & Greene, 2003; Greene & Gordon, 2007).	3.14
Midden seems to be marked in some olfactory way, since removing midden from nests makes them more likely to be invaded by other species (Gordon, 35).	2.82
All of these chemical receptors will be arranged in an array on a pair of chemical stalks, with four of each type of receptor per stalk.	3.0
These will be located in different places: the sprayer for the successful patroller pheromone will be located on the rear at the base of Antie, corresponding to the glands that researchers believe the ants drag along behind them to mark returning paths, while the successful forager and cuticular hydrocarbon sprayers will be located on the skirt.	3.0
The Behavior	3.0
To ease Antie’s on-board memory requirements and processing capabilities (and to make all the rest of the pseudocode easier for the reader to understand), I propose a few global variables and subroutines.	3.11
For a simple start, the forward cruise function will merely take in a double integer representing a speed and cause Antie to move forward at this speed.	3.0
Antie will be equipped to navigate in this environment and will be designed to find seeds in sandy soil.	3.0
The orientation and distance should be calculable by the polarization pattern according to the system set up by Lambrinos, et al.	3.0
In-nest navigation will be a function of the temperature, read by Antie’s thermometer and a light source.	3.2
Antie will also need to follow several different kinds of chemical gradient trails: it will need to track the trails left by successful patrollers, and localize the source of food-odors and midden-odors.	3.1
Note that a portion of this subroutine does run on a schema basis:	3.0
Unfortunately, as of yet, no robot has managed to fool a human for more than a few seconds, and no robot has been created that can integrate itself into human society.	2.6
When both sonar sensors are stimulated simultaneously, Antie will check hydrocarbon inputs and determine whether the detected object is a nestmate.	3.0
Antie will attempt to determine the tasks of other ants by sensing only the n-alkene levels.	3.0
The second behavior, patrolling, involves two sub-behaviors: nest patrolling and trail patrolling.	3.0
It is therefore reasonable to assign a constant age at which Antie will switch from nest patrolling to trail patrolling.	3.0
In order to perform both of these functions, Antie will need a subroutine to explore in a zig-zag fashion, as harvester ants do (Gordon, 34).	2.88
Nest patrollers will only call this behavior for a short distance before returning to the nest to idle for a few minutes and exit again.	3.1
It would also keep track of whether the last rotation was clockwise or counter-clockwise.	3.0
Of course, what makes Antie an innovative robot is the task-switching between these larger behaviors.	3.1
Workers probably switch to patrolling based on their perceived life expectancy and as a function of a gene whose expression changes between young and old ants, and this is easily emulated using a clock pulse counter in Antie’s CPU that will count its “age” since last boot.	3.0
To remind the reader, this technique was implemented earlier in this proposal to create the limited task-switching between nest patrolling and trail patrolling.	3.0
The switch from patrolling to foraging has been modeled as a function of successful foragers’ returns with great accuracy by Schafer, et al (2006), and evidence from experiments in which successful foragers were removed before reentry to the nest does support the theory that returning successful foragers have an effect on the activation of new foragers (Gordon, 2002).	3.2
Conclusion	3.0
Antie will also feature a skirt of bump sensors, sonar detectors and chemical emitters, including sacs of hydrocarbons extracted from ants of the nest being infiltrated and pheromones for successful patrolling and foraging.	3.11
Sensors	3.0
In order to inform itself about its environment, Antie will need a number of sensors.	3.0
The sonar will constantly be detecting nearby objects and initiate an escape maneuver when their inputs pass a certain threshold of stimulation, and the bump sensors will, when depressed, also initiate the escape function.	3.0
Antie would use a system for processing the input from its polarization compass based on the compass designed by Lambrinos, Moller, Labhart, Pfeifer and Wehner in 2000, consisting of two photodiodes with blue filters and polarizers.	3.0
The difference of their logarithmized signals would be returned to Antie, who will use a simultaneous model to navigate returns to the nest: Upon each exit from the nest, Antie will take a single 360o scan of the sky, and will orient itself according to an analytical procedure to derive compass information from different polarization patterns perceived later.	3.0
Or massive bio-chemical attack!	2.8
And I think this is what they are waiting for.	3.2
So the Bush administration can keep claiming that we are safer now, under their policies.	3.0

NEUTRALIZING TERRORISM	2.8
So you end up fighting the entire population.	2.7
Beyond these two sources, there is virtually no terrorist activity in the world, with the possible exception of localized disputes such as in Northern Ireland and occasional domestic episodes in various places involving isolated disaffected groups.	2.92
BIG PICTURE	3.0
A big picture of our entire Anti-Terrorism strategy can be found at our website	2.9
Blessings to you.	4.0
Before 9/11, terrorism was confined to a small number of extremist individuals, loosely linked by radical Islam and hatred of Israel and its sole supporter, the USA.	2.9
May God help us all.	2.5
Although the motivic relationship between the Introduction and the first theme of the exposition smooth the transition, nearly every other element changes when the first theme appears.	3.0
Harmonic Structure and Form	3.2
The drastic tempo and meter changes as well as the first appearances of staccato articulations make it clear to the listener that the introduction is over.	2.9
As Example 10 shows, the chords are more-or-less in duple meter (4/8 and 2/8) with one “hiccup” occurring in the 5/8 measure.	3.1
As we will later see, this dissonance disappears when this theme returns in the recapitulation.	2.86
Example 11 illustrates this structure.	3.0
Note that the initial G♯ is a pickup to the section in C♯, which fills in the whole-tone descent from E♭ to C♯ with the intervening fourth.	3.0
Wilson claims that C and E♭ are “local dominants” to F in this first section of the exposition.	3.0
E♭, furthermore, is not convincingly established as a dominant-functioning tone at all.	2.9
This creates both a smooth transition to the second theme and a strong sense that a new section is beginning, a combination that is generally rather difficult to forge.	3.0
Hence, measures 155-210 constitute the bass progression B-E♭-D♭-B; the same stepwise descent (E♭-D♭) occurred in the first theme group while F rather than B was being prolonged.	3.0
“a transformation in rhythm and contour of the second head-motive of [the first-theme],”	3.0
Wilson, 182.	3.0
While Wilson rightly identifies the resultant set of measures 261-264 as 6-Z50 ([014679]), identifying it as such does not offer much analytical insight until we point out that this is a simple extension of the intervallic sequence (+5, -2, +5) from the original motive.	3.0
The second section of the development is in C♯ (which is sometimes spelled D♭).	2.9
This section returns to the calm simplicity (and tempo) of the second section, though apart from affect there are no references to that section.	3.0
Although the C♯ major chord in measure 293, preceded by A♭ major (V) in measure 285, suggests C♯ as tonal center, the tonality is not strongly established until measure 303.	3.0
The third section of the development takes the trombone motive from the transition between the first and second sections of the exposition shown in Example 12, transposed to begin on F, and turns it into a fugato sequence, reproduced in Example 17.	3.0
The second and fourth entrances of the fugato subject are transposed up a perfect fifth, but the first note is B♭ rather than C, which allows Bartók to remain in this pentatonic set (and also to reinforce B♭ as tonal center).	3.0
Both B♭ and A♭ are chromatic neighbors to A, which intensifies the arrival on A, and brings out the fact that the appearance of A continues the large-scale whole-tone descent that has been left stranded on B for the entire development section.	3.0
In the recapitulation of this theme, shown in Example 19, the first chord is an F-major chord, and the A♭ is replaced by A♮ in the melody.	2.91
In fact, the chord progression of the first four measures of Example 19 can be thought of tonally as I-vi-V in F major—while we are reluctant to say that this passage is in major (the conspicuous A♭ in measure 490 easily brings doubt to this interpretation), we can certainly say that the minor flare of the beginning has been replaced by a major flare here in the recapitulation.	3.0
The abbreviations FTG and STG stand for First Theme Group and Second Theme Group, respectively.	3.0
While “tonality” in this piece (and in Bartók’s music in general) is quite different from its classical interpretation, we find that the harmonic structure is at least analogous to the standard sonata-form structure.	3.1
To begin with, the movement is in F.	3.0
Beginning with the exposition, the large-scale progression of tonal centers is a whole-tone descent from F to F, represented by the stemmed notes in Example 2, while the Introduction ascends from C♯ to F through D♯ (shown as D♭ and E♭ in the graph) in a quasi-bass Anstieg.	3.29
The middle pitch of the descent, B, acts as the “dominant” to F, based on its symmetrical division of the whole-tone scale and the fact that the second theme appears in B in the exposition.	3.0
Bartók has often applied a tonic-dominant relationship to a pitch-class and its tritone partner, and even admits to using that as a compositional framework in his fifth string quartet.	2.9
Our analysis will focus instead on relating the foreground activity to the overarching background structure.	3.0
The Introduction does not relate thematically to any of the main sections of the movement—in fact, it is the third movement that draws its thematic material from this section—but the harmonic and motivic principles at play here foreshadow some important elements of the entire piece.	3.0
The pentatonic set here is exclusively a pitch-class set, and its incarnations throughout the movement are devoid of any connotations associated with the pentatonic scale.	3.0
The perfect fourth in fact generates much of the motivic and harmonic material of the entire movement, and its importance is immediately evident in the Introduction with the opening bass motive.	3.12
Example 5 shows the true dominance of the perfect fourth; the set created is a ten-note set derived by stacking fourths.	2.9
If we begin from the final D♯ and ascend the circle of fourths until we reach C we obtain the entire set presented in this example.	3.0
For this reason white walls are favored over colored ones for both galleries and architectural spaces.	3.13
What exactly is the debate between colorlessness vs color and more specifically can black and white be considered non-colors?	2.9
Thus said, the use of black in white in wardrobe perhaps was a way for the new bourgeoisie to distinguish themselves from the decadence of the upper class and the vulgarity from the low.	3.0
“In the prevailing styles of the European bourgeoisie, there long survived a tendency to limit the use of color, with strong emphasis on what are generally thought of as non colors, such as white, black and gray”	2.9
Another reason why it is believed that the bourgeoisie took preference in black and white is because of the Victorian sobriety of the age and their obsession with purity and cleanliness.	3.0
Wearing black and white also marked the distinction of labor between men and women and in a highly rigid and segmented society, the wearing of different colors seemed the most obvious way to do so.	2.9
Above all, it is believed that the expanse of literacy and the printed word, mainly the newspaper, had a profound effect in influencing the choice of black and white.	3.33
The explosion of mass production and printing allowed for a plethora of colorful advertising and consumer goods which came to be known as kitsch.	3.33
Greenberg continues by saying, “Kitsch, using for raw material the debased and academicized simulacra of genuine culture, welcomes and cultivates this insensibility.	3.0
It is the source of its profits. Kitsch is mechanical and operates by formulas.	3.25
Kitsch is the epitome of all that is spurious in the life of our times.	2.9
At the same time in our modern society, color has been seen as an external threat to be purged from the enlightened mind and space.	2.9
colorlessness needs color in order to for the full aesthetic experience to take place.	3.1
color is seen as corrupting, intoxicating, disorienting and in art, has come to be associated with the vulgar and the kitsch.	2.56
“The predominance of color at the expense of drawing is a usurpation of the relative over the absolute, of fleeting appearance over permanent form, of physical impression over the empire of the soul”	2.89
color rests on the surface of an object, it is superficial, cosmetic and therefore deceptive since it hides the true nature of that thing.	2.8
For [Charles Blanc] color also represents a kind of ruination. color for him signifies the mythical savage state out of which civilization, the nobility of the human spirit, slowly, heroically, has lifted itself – but back into which it could always slide	3.14
It is a descent in the way it makes one lose consciousness and enter into the physical world of desire, and to desire is to lose control over oneself.	3.4
Thus, began the cult of the black and white.	3.0
It is neither grey white, nor vory white, but pure white.	3.0
We have superceded both the ‘brown’ of decadence and classiscm and the ‘blue’ of divisionism, the cult of the blue ky, the gods with green beards and the spectrum.	3.2
WHITE pure white.	2.88
For these reasons black and white have been placed at the top of the hierarchy of colors.	3.1
The use of white is therefore decisive for the bodily appearance of a space.	3.0
There are 13 AVAs in Sonoma County.	3.0

They [Honore Comfort and the Sonoma County Vintners] point to the prestige that the "Napa Valley" designation carries.	3.0
But this prestige has nothing to due with the law that demands "Napa Valley", in addition to simply "Rutherford", be placed on these wines.	2.9
Sonoma County, with roughly half of the wineries of Napa County, wins roughly twice as many gold medals in national and international wine competitions.	3.6
I disagree, but I am eternally hopeful, optimistic that the Sonoma County Vintners will inject a little passion and not more of the same old staid and boring in their marketing communications.	3.12
Honore Comfort, Executive Director of the Sonoma County Vintners Association and an outstanding representative for Sonoma County wines noted this: ".	3.11
They point to the prestige that the "Napa Valley" designation carries.	3.12
The vintners in Sonoma County simply can't make a case for "Sonoma County" having any meaning or for a region as vast as "Sonoma County" delivering any degree of quality to the grapes.	3.0
It also is a 'social promotion' in the sense that great Sonoma wines that now are forced to use "Sonoma County" will be giving some of their credibility to their lesser neighbors.	3.1
John Kelly said...	3.0
And so is every other producer I have discussed this issue with.	2.8
I completely agree with you when you state: "Such an association will not be made with 'Sonoma County' wines...ever."	2.8

John, Good of you to comment and good to have dissent.	3.5
Bill Cadman said...	3.0
There was a counterpoint in the label world after some court cases resulted in a company's revising its grape sourcing to comply with tightened requirements for 75% in-county fruit in order to remain legal in designating the wine as from "Napa".	2.75
One rambling article's author counted 16 occurrences of the word Napa on the newly designed label of a famous budget wine producer's 2005 Napa cabernet sauvignon.	2.9
I was disappointed, though not surprised, to see that today a conjunctive labeling law dictating that "Sonoma County" be placed on every label on wines produced from grapes grown in Sonoma County was unanimously passed by the California Legislature .	2.6

"not withstanding that the state or territorial law may burden interstate commerce or an act of congress, the state law shall be upheld..."	3.0
This claim by the wholesalers that H.R. 5034 "does not amend" federal regulations on alcohol is a straight up misrepresentation.	2.7
"does not amend"	2.71
More importantly, the very language of H.R. 5034 gives states the explicit right to discriminate against out-of-state wine shippers.	2.6
one of those "justifications", the bill states, is maintenance of the "structure of the state alcoholic beverage distribution system."	3.0
The state needs no justification to discriminate against out-of-state retailers.	2.78
"Over half the states have been sued challenging their alcohol laws.	3.0

After that, the state legislatures, in every state where litigation has affected badly crafted laws, went about legislating a fix.	3.1

The El Rancho Vegas (1941) was the first, followed by the Last Frontier (1943).	3.0
When the Flamingo opened in December 1946, it did so with Hollywood flair and the new Vegas flash.	3.1
From the mid-1940s to the mid-1960s, Las Vegas nurtured a growing sense that it was the “Entertainment Capital of the World. ”	3.1
Emerging stars, no longer content with playing small nightclubs, came to Las Vegas with dreams of making it big.	3.3
Though Las Vegas had developed a powerful local economy, few major outside investments were made in the city, due primarily to mob infiltration and its inherent ties to illegal activities.	2.9
Several weeks later he was asked — then ordered — to vacate the room to make room for high rollers, whereupon he promptly bought the property and fired the management.	2.8
That, combined with the formation of the Nevada Gaming Control Board, would signal the beginning of the end for heavy mob influence in the city.	3.0
What was once a sure thing became much more competitive.	2.7
Wynn’s demolition of the existing properties started a trend that, more than any other, describes Las Vegas at the end of the 20th century: removal of old properties in exchange for the potential of new ones.	3.0
This trend has led to many more demolitions, including the Dunes (replaced by Bellagio), Aladdin (the new Aladdin) and Sands (Venetian) hotels.	2.91
Over 20,000 additional hotel rooms have been added in a few short years, including resorts in Summerlin and Lake Las Vegas.	3.5
The growth that has characterized Las Vegas for nearly a century may be facing a roadblock.	2.56
Still, the future of Las Vegas is sure to be determined as much by the pioneering spirit that built the city as by anything else.	3.3
It was not until 1829 that Rafael Rivera, a Mexican scout, found a spring-fed valley and dubbed it Las Vegas — a Spanish name that leaves many modern visitors wondering exactly where “the meadows” really lay.	3.2

As a homosexual, one risks horrifying their parents, other family members, and friends to the point of losing all contact with them, ruining their career, being condemned by their religion, being beat up for publicly displaying their sexuality, and much much more.	2.6
This shows that not only did Plato consider it normal for a male to be attracted to another male, he also believed that it began at a very young age, as the word “boyhood” signifies.	3.0

All in all, Woods views homosexuality as “fascinating.”	3.0
According to Darwin’s theory of natural selection, the advantageous traits are passed on, while the disadvantageous ones eventually die out.	3.0
Therefore, from the evolutionary standpoint, homosexuality becomes one of the disadvantageous traits.	3.0
Perhaps one may have a genetic predisposition towards homosexuality that has been passed on from previous generations.	2.9
However this does not necessarily determine a homosexual; rather this predisposition must be triggered by environmental factors.	3.0

While both stories each characterize Madame White Snake fairly consistently within their narratives, the uneven characterization in film noir perhaps mirrors the evolution of her character over time: readers may not be sure whether she is a pure villainess or whether she is a good wife who is badly treated by society, because there is evidence of both throughout her legend.	3.12
The complications in her character serve to undercut the ostensible didactic intent of these stories.	2.7

But are the morals of these stories entirely sincere?	3.0
While both these stories are ostensibly morality tales about the dangerous beauty of this femme fatale, the true source of pleasure from these narratives is the femme fatale’s transgressive behavior, not her eventual punishment for it.	3.0

"On Tinian, and probably elsewhere, the Seabees were building enormous hospitals while we were there,"	3.1
They were for (an expected invasion of Japan).	2.78
And the first person he chose to join him was Karnes, though he couldn't reveal the mission to Karnes.	3.0
They were a wartime match that changed the world.	3.0
Karnes met Tibbets when the 29-year-old bomber pilot walked into Karnes' office at Wendover Army Air Field on the Utah-Nevada border.	3.0
And he immediately liked Karnes, who showed him around the base.	3.5
In Karnes, Tibbets found a kindred spirit -- and a handball partner.	3.1
Tibbets was a decorated, top-gun pilot, but Karnes could wrangle the military rule book as well as Tibbets could fly.	2.8
I was very lucky to have Tom.	3.6

He said that they had split the atom and that we were going to drop an atomic bomb,"	2.78
Karnes arrived on Tinian on May 18, 1945, as part of an advance team that flew in the five C-54 transport planes of the 509th.	3.0
Karnes handed out bunk assignments, choosing the mess officer, Chuck Perry, to share his tent.	3.0
The word spread: "This is it.	3.0
Karnes and hundreds of other men from the 509th stood along the flight line as Tibbets and the Enola Gay took off at 2:45 a.m. on Aug. 6, a warm, tropical night.	3.0
The crew slipped on dark glasses to prepare for the blinding flash of the bomb.	2.7
At 8:15 a.m. Hiroshima time, the pneumatic bomb-bay doors opened and "Little Boy," equivalent to 20,000 tons of TNT, fell out.	2.0
The Enola Gay climbed, and Tibbets fought to turn the plane in the air-bending, 155-degree the crews had been practicing off Tinian for months.	3.0
When the bomb exploded as planned 1,890 feet over Hiroshima, Tibbets' mouth tingled, and he tasted the lead fillings in his teeth.	2.7
The crew was horrified by the purple mushroom cloud that climbed to 10 miles and looked as if it would engulf the Enola Gay.	2.3
I'd never written up any award,"	2.89
When an unsuspecting Tibbets descended from the Enola Gay on Tinian, he barely managed to palm his pipe as Gen. Carl Spaatz, commander of the Strategic Air Forces, stepped forward to pin the medal on his bomb flight coveralls.	3.12
Karnes, like the hundreds of others gathered along the flight line, was jubilant.	3.5
Three days later, another B-29 from the 509th bombed Nagasaki.	2.33
Five days later, Japan surrendered and World War II was over.	3.3
“Nathan,”	3.0
“Rachel met someone last night whom it is best never to meet.	2.5
“Just ignore that,” he told me.	2.71
As we kept driving, the anxiety grew more pronounced.	2.6
He parked and got out.	2.9
“Is it really safe to leave the car …”	2.6
Inside, the building opened up.	2.91
His skin was brown and stretched, like some diseased sapling’s bark.	2.56
Under matted hair, his eyes had slit pupils.	2.9
She came down here with someone after a party, and I don’t think it was one of your average pixies.”	2.9
It almost looked like the light bent around him without actually touching him directly.	3.2
He wasn’t a person you’d describe with normal adjectives, you know?”	2.9
He really stood out.	3.12
I remember that he hardly ever moved, just stared at Rachel.	2.8
Even when he talked, he hardly opened his mouth.	3.0
The two glanced at each other.	3.1
“You’re a wonder, Dvorov.	3.86
The hunchback pulled out a scrap of paper and scribbled something on it with his fingernail, then handed it to Nepthys.	3.0

Love-ins, raves, gatherings where society is put on hold and humans open themselves to emotion: that is where entities from this world tend to go when they cross over, and that is where Rachel met someone from this world.	3.2
“It’s from Mitch,”	3.11
“Nathan, you told me five minutes ago that you would do anything to help Rachel.	2.8
Now, the more we can do before nightfall, the better.”	3.11
“Nathan, I told you: my family owes yours a debt.	3.0
I caught my breath and forced myself to look him in the eye.	2.9
“He says we should meet him tonight, there’s a good one going on in that church that closed down last month.”	3.0
“What is your name, anyway?”	3.1
What you may call me is Nepthys.”	3.0
“Just at this corner,” he said, interrupting my immanent panic attack, “we’re going to stop and turn three times widdersh – er, counterclockwise, then face east.	3.0
When it had all burnt, a thin outline of a doorframe appeared on the wall across from our corner.	2.9
The thing tending the cart reminded me of the caterpillar from Alice in Wonderland: it had the same opium-dream wise man quality I’d always given the caterpillar.	3.29
Its arms were thin and long enough to reach any herbs from its cushion in the center of the cart, and with its long, many-shouldered pole of a torso, it rose over our heads even while seated.	3.0
Please, let yourselves breathe the fine scent of these herbs.”	3.29
Please, if we could see him, we would be much obliged.	3.64
he looked at me “ – to close it.”	3.0
At the top was one door.	3.0
He opened one eye when we came in but did not move.	2.9
I said.	3.0
There’s an entire industry in my world based around how unkillable they are.	2.7
It’s been over a week, and I want to dance.	3.56
They’re almost as rare here, and I’ve never heard a reliable story of someone successfully fighting a vampire.”	3.09
Okay?	2.91
The little man drew a few loud breaths that died in the wooden room’s tight air.	2.55
Finally, in a pinched rasp, he said, “My information is purely for the purposes of a collector.	2.75
It would allow me to leave this bed, despite my current illness.	3.2
Outside, the thing at the herb cart nodded when we mentioned the stone.	2.9
“Good evening, gentlemen,” she said.	3.63
“No, thank you,”	2.8
“we regret that we cannot take up your kind offer. Are you the proprietor of this shop?”	3.0
“Yes,”	3.4
“Yes,” answered the woman.	3.29
The woman laughed.	3.86
“Why, the merchandise, of course,” she said.	3.0
In its center, under a spearing, white light, was a golden table draped with a blue velvet cloth, on which lay a gray, plum-sized rock.	3.1
“You wouldn’t give me the human, would you?	3.0
“that would make the stone rather useless.”	2.75
Nevertheless, she gave me what I can only describe as an “appraising glance”.	3.4
We don’t – ”	2.8
“A pint?	3.0
I have his health to consider.”	2.82
Nepthys turned to me.	3.0
“Well, kid, what do you think?	2.86
Come on, I don’t have to get fucked up every time we go out just to enjoy myself.	2.27
Soon, she came back with a lidded ceramic bowl, which she put on the table beside me.	3.0
“Roll up your sleeves,” she told me.	3.0
“They take about a quarter-pint each,” said Madame Entera, drawing out another skinny leech.	3.0
We’ll be done with them before your hair is finished.”	3.1
Half an hour later, I left the room pale and bald, running my fingers over my scalp.	2.5
Madame Entera took me back up to the stone’s room, where Nepthys was waiting by the door.	3.1
When our drinks came, he poured a dollop of something from an inner pocket into my Bloody Mary.	2.7
It won’t refill your blood supply, but while that’s in your system, you won’t even need blood.”	3.12
I took about half of the Bloody Mary in one gulp and then ate the celery.	3.0
“Okay,” I said, “now that we’re sitting down, can you explain a little more of what’s going on here?	3.0
“now that we’re sitting down, can you explain a little more of what’s going on here?	2.9
This place is just a little of both.	3.0
The Europeans mostly manifest as something like the underground society of your cities.	2.86
We aren’t quite what you’d expect from reading the Grimms.”	2.9
“You figure they’re some Lincoln-green pretty boys who run around in the forest with bows and live forever in halls of glory, right?	3.0
Except it’s worse here because they have centuries to grow disaffected and flirt with exciting and dangerous elements of society’s lowest rungs.	2.7
Some of them actually commit to this society, though.	3.0
When they do decide to do something for real, they’re always the best at it.”	3.43
If it was March, that meant that we’d been together almost a year and a half.	3.2
“I don’t know …hey, what about the nature spirits, things like that?	3.0
Sure, I miss having a place to settle down, but it’s better than waiting to get dammed.”	2.86
“Shouldn’t you be going light on the vodka?	2.89
Now spring was back, under the concrete, and I could smell it even here.	3.1
Come on, let’s go.”	3.2
I undid the strings and let the pouch sit on my palm so that I could see the stone inside.	3.37
As long as I looked at it, it didn’t reveal any magic sparkle or glow.	2.75
Suddenly, what looked like a little kid darted out of an alley and almost ran into me.	2.62
“I agree,” I told him.	3.2
The air around me seemed to still sound, and light came in around the corners of my eyes.	3.2
“Do you know what this thing does?”	3.0
“I think I understand why we got that stone from a slave shop,”	2.5
When she didn’t move, I knelt down and put a hand to her brow.	2.8
I opened my mouth to ask for an explanation, but Nepthys stopped me.	2.7
“Don’t name her ‘What did you say?’, okay?	2.7
The next thing that comes out of your mouth is probably what she’ll respond to until we figure out how to put her back.”	3.0
Nepthys looked at me incredulously.	3.14
Amy smiled at me and let go of my arm, but not before she brought my fingers to her lips and gave them one soft kiss.	3.8
I stood up and Amy stood with me.	3.2
“I suppose so,”	3.0
…I thought as much.	2.73
We left.	2.9
Nepthys shook his hands at me like he wanted to wrap them around my neck.	2.3
We slammed against the doorway and I was laughing too, the pulse close enough to shake the doorframe and set up vibrations in my chest, Rachel in my arms because she’d used me to soften her landing.	4.1
“do you know how much you’ve set us back?	2.2
I thought about Rachel; in the excitement, I had forgotten why we were chasing down vampire experts.	3.1
“Okay,” he said as we hit the street, “we’re going to see another friend of mine.	3.3
“we’re going to see another friend of mine.	3.1
He was naked, but there was nothing to hide: his body was hairless and completely smooth.	3.3
The man closed his eyes.	3.0
I shivered as I walked past the pale man’s blank eyes, wondering what they were staring at.	2.0
“It is an honor to meet you, Lady Isis,”	3.5
“Oh, precious!	4.0
I don’t wish to be reminded of how old I actually am.”	2.5
A wave to the pale men brought a bottle of red wine and a platter of grapes.	3.3
He poured a dollop of the clear liquid into one cup and passed it to me.	3.11
This story might be interesting.	3.2
“That sweet, small nose, and her soft lips – she’d kiss well, I should think, if gently.	3.82
Good, round breasts, too, even though they’re small, they suit her.”	3.75
“Mmm,”	3.5
I couldn’t tell what the thoughtful look on her face meant.	3.0
Isis …you know some way to locate the undead, don’t you?”	2.9
“I do.	3.1
Describe this one to me.	3.0
“You do?”	2.86
“That’s amazing!”	4.3
I would have sworn to you that he was dead.	2.6
Rachel stepped forward into the crowd while I took a moment to drink in the ceiling’s blue-lit, shadowed vault and the light-catching haze from who-knows-what rising between the DJ and the crowd.	3.2
The pools in her hands grew deeper.	3.0
Shivers swept through her body, and Nepthys reached out to touch her but I stopped him.	2.6
Her hands twitched and a drop of blood shook out, splashing on the crease of her thigh and hanging to one strand of the black hair between her legs.	2.43
Now Nepthys lunged forward, took her by the arms.	3.0
“Isis, what happened?	2.9
“What did you say?”	2.75
asked Nepthys.	3.0
When she finally spoke, I had to lean close to hear her.	3.0
“I found your vampire,”	3.1
“but he might know that someone’s looking for him. He’s taken great pains to keep himself hidden.	2.8
“One of these will lead you out.”	3.0
I stood, and one of her servants took me and Amy to the door.	3.0
Nepthys caught up with us after a minute and walked silently to the end of the hall.	3.0
“Mountain ash,” said Nepthys.	2.88
“That was very kind of her.”	3.62
Closing the box, he paused beside the open door and looked back at me.	3.2
“I really hope we find your Rachel,”	2.86
In a few minutes, we were back to the first door we’d knocked on in this town and Dvorov himself was greeting us.	3.4
You got the sucker already?”	3.1
You’re crazy.	2.57
“I guess, man, but be quick.	3.0
I don’t want my customers thinkin’ that anything’s wrong, you know?”	2.4
Something with too many arms was manning the turntables above the crowd, which looked more impenetrable tonight than ever before.	3.0
Just in front of me, a massive thing slammed into the wall, sending up a cloud of granite dust.	2.71
Then a looming shape to my right fell away, and I saw him in a flash of the strobe, his black eyes staring deadly into the crowd.	2.44
It was Dvorov.	2.9
“It must have been wishful thinking.”	2.4
I turned to keep going, but he caught my arm again.	2.33
I shook him off and squeezed between two dancing nymphs, getting almost to the edge of the dance floor.	3.0
On the floor was Dvorov’s head, separated from his body by several feet and a growing puddle of dark blood.	2.2
It flashed in the strobe where it wasn’t streaked with Dvorov’s blood.	2.7
A black hallway opened into a space like a cathedral.	3.1
Footsteps echoed through the stone chamber, and the sound reflected back to me from everywhere.	3.0
I couldn’t tell how many people were running, much less where they were.	2.75
Taste, hearing and touch became a single blur, and I do not know if my eyes were open.	2.8
I pulled the vial of liquid that he’d been giving me from his pocket and ran to the altar.	3.0
He didn’t move, just stared and held his drink.	2.9
I walked across what had been the dance floor.	2.9
I realized that Rachel had disappeared without leaving a clue and I had no way to do anything but wait for her to show up – which, if she were in a situation where I should be doing something, would probably be never.	2.4
What?	2.9
She didn’t come home last night, none of her friends have seen her.	2.4
…Sir, if she’s in any danger, it will probably be too late to help her by that time.	2.4
…Yes, sir.	3.1
It slowed down as it neared me and I started to worry.	2.2
This wasn’t the best of neighborhoods.	2.6
I kept my eyes straight ahead and tried to walk more quickly without showing it.	2.9
I heard an automatic window roll down.	3.0
“Okay,” I said.	2.9
Now, will you tell me how you know my family, and how you happened to be driving by just now?	2.75
“That’s enough!	2.6
I can only answer one question at a time.	2.9
Labor costs in America continued to go up, draining US companies of their resources, while companies overseas were able to cut labor costs and put that money back into updating and renovating their facilities.	2.89
America’s steel remained unsold, flooding the world market with inferior products that no one wanted to buy.	2.8
J. Philip Richley, a union member and organizer of many attempts to save 5the mills, has summed it up thus: “You just can’t solve a nation-wide problem in a single city.”	2.9
The people of Youngstown, being now unemployed had very little money to spend on anything but staying alive.	2.22
College tuition, clothes, food, and heating all had to come before donations to non-profit organizations.	2.9
Letters and petitions were all very well, but they did little to improve the situation.	2.56
Beyond that, no one knew how they should proceed: everyone knew that saving the mills was important, but nobody stepped forward with a full-fledged plan to do it without losing huge amounts of money and dragging even more people down.	2.27
The Campaign failed to save any jobs and Youngstown was plunged into economic chaos.	2.44
The Apathy of USWA	2.75
Rather than sit back and wait for their jobs to be snatched away, the workers and local union members in the mills fought long and hard to be able to keep the factories open.	3.0
Actually, one main reason for the behavior of the USWA was that union leaders really had no idea what to do.	2.8
Rather than try and come up with some sort of scenario, the USWA simply ignored what was going on in Youngstown, hoping that perhaps the problem would resolve itself, or at least not spread any further than it already had.	2.5
This would mean that UWSA would lose credibility with the American government and its people, something they could not afford to do.	2.5
Therefore, they decided to withdraw support and let the local branch fight it out alone.	2.8
Unemployment is low in comparison with surrounding towns, and the streets are clean and well kept.	3.7
For the people of Youngstown, Black Monday was not just a historical event- it was the most important event in their lives.	3.0
An Extended Essay in History	3.0
Although it affected Youngstown and the surrounding area more than it affected other regions, the local people simply could not solve a national crisis on a local level.	2.5
In 1973, the Experimental Negotiating Agreement was signed.	3.1
Old technology was not replaced, obsolete methods were not updated, and almost none of the industry’s profits were being utilized to help modernize.	2.8
The announcement of the closing of the mills in 1977 was the beginning of a downward spiral, which would send the entire valley into chaos and ruin.	2.6
“to get up a petition to stop the shutdown,”	3.1
The petition was circulated, eventually including thousands of signatures; it was then given to USWA representatives to present to President Carter in Washington.	3.2
However, the representatives were shunted to the side and ignored in Washington, since Youngstown’s political influence had died with its industry.	2.86
The Coalition drafter letters to the Lykes Company asking if a group of workers might purchase the mill and run it collectively.	3.12
These attempts to save the mills were hindered by several major factors, including the decline of the world steel market, which made American steel impossible to sell or export.	2.75
The Decline of the World Market	2.1
The efforts to save the mills failed partly because the international market for steel had largely dried up.	2.6
Foreign steel was easier and more efficient to make, and was often of higher quality than domestic steel.	3.1
Mahoning County was a one-industry area, and the people of Youngstown, Struthers, Campbell, Boardman Township, and the numerous other small towns and villages in the area only had one main employer: the steel mills.	3.0
Foreign steel companies invested in their factories, updating their technology and replacing their equipment often.	3.1
This meant that foreign facilities were more modern and efficient than any plants in America, and therefore were able to export a more competitive product.	2.78
Foreign steel was also much cheaper.	3.0
Or you could go out to the shed and grab a few handfuls of that sod mix you got at that estate sale last year and get to mixing.	3.1

"Why is that more desirable than what you write today?"	3.14

"So at its heart, then, your writing – as opposed to working otherwise – is for yourself?"	3.09

Tell them, and they will create an audience.	3.12
He contemplated a story, an outline he had laboriously constructed some time ago.	3.0
Allan filled page after page, the words escaping from his mind onto the paper.	3.0
Do you personally despise the works the Enlightenment or the progress made since Shakespeare?	2.75
"Then why," Arthur barreled on, "do you disregard them all and return to this superstitious babble, this morbid, paganistic drivel?	2.27
He glared at Allan, eyes impaling him and demanding a response.	2.38
Allan cried out at last, stepping forward and casting his arms open, confronting Arthur with this demanding, pleading interrogation.	2.46
"Its twigs rap constantly against the wall, the wind always demanding my attention.	2.78
"Very well,"	3.0
With that, he tossed the papers at Allan and left the room.	2.3
Nathan read the package of words in silence, his only motions the steady progress of his eyes and occasional replacement of pages.	3.0
Allan sat nervously across from him in a chair Nathan had probably upholstered himself, a patchwork design of fabric containing easily more stuffing than any other furniture item of the period.	3.0
"you don't think it's a waste of ink and paper, a futile expedition into morbidity or literary debauchery?"	2.4
I hardly dare to think it, but – I may finish this story!	3.5
He considered Arthur's intervention; considered that it might be better to accept the fog and continue as his lifelong friend had suggested, to write stories that others would read; for after all, what purpose writing if not to be read?	3.3
Indeed, if he still could not, he could at any time follow Arthur's advice and seek a profession more grounded in reality.	3.0
As the stream wound its way through the largest pines, grown so great as to eclipse that feature of the landscape they had once crowded about for sweet water as saplings, Allan continued, slowing his pace to climb across the toes of the slumbering giants.	3.0
Fallen trunks lay rotting across the rivulet; the living elders oversaw the grove while younger trees, still small and not yet as knotted and gnarled as their forefathers, sprang up where branches reached the ground.	3.1
Collapsing at its base, Allan wrapped his arms around the stoic tree and let forth a moan, a cry of purest agony that escaped him as the first tears seeped from the corners of his eyes and slid down his cheeks, falling to the ground and seeping though the fallen leaves and needles to join the water of the stream, flowing through the ground beneath them.	2.0
The great, jaundiced eye stared down unblinkingly at the author, who gazed up through his window's tiny frame with trepidation.	2.5
His pen flickered forth, words dancing out from its nib.	3.3
He held a hand to his forehead, eyes closed and face flushed.	2.5
His breath returning to its normal rhythms, he dared to look at the page before him.	3.0
His face soft as if caught between a smile and tears, he draped his loose cape over her shoulders.	3.2
A magnificent glow infused the carriage as they merged with the sky's glory.	3.7
"will you never leave me be?	2.18
Allan took a sandwich between his fingers.	3.0
"Thank you, Arthur."	3.9
The only other illumination came from a lurid moonlight filtered through thin branches and clouds, casting its bone-pale glow onto the pine floorboards.	3.0
"Perfectly dreadful, my dear Mr. Mason," Allan sighed.	2.4
"I'm not familiar with Mr. Poe's works, but I assume you're referring to your unhealthy penchant for the fantastic."	2.9
This is more like a compulsion, a beast that lies waiting in the dark for the perfect moment, then leaps and takes ahold of me, screaming out through my quill."	2.8
"How perfectly awful."	2.2
"Perhaps you could make some headway if you denied your darker side the outlet of the colorful metaphors you so enjoy.	2.6
There simply is no audience for fairy tales – no literate audience, at least."	2.43
"It is true," Allan admitted, fidgeting with his cufflinks, "that I would not dream of submitting one of these corruptions of literature to any publisher.	2.5
The lines of letters stepped into their divisions, in the shape of a story's outline: the loose, dry skeleton of a tale lay exposed beneath their feet, awaiting tendons, muscle and blushing skin.	2.8
He scratched the back of his dark-haloed head and blinked bleary eyes.	2.83
"Perhaps you require a rest from writing," suggested Arthur.	2.7
"I shall consider it; in the meantime, however, I must be off.	3.0
You have been a gracious host, as always."	4.0
Arthur rose and shook his hand.	3.22
"Nathan?"	3.0
The reply came from above him and Allan turned to see his friend reclining in the fork of a great tree.	3.2

There used to be a local tradition in this area: at each spring tide , the local community would head out to the bogs and marshes to harvest the grasses.	3.25

About 2 km (a mile) east of Wan Chai, Causeway Bay is second only to Tsim Sha Tsui as Hong Kong’s place to shop.	3.0
Silent for a time, the tradition has been revived and is a tourist attraction.	3.55

Among the ponds is one inhabited by turtles: Visitors toss in coins in the hope of bouncing one off a turtle’s head, a sure way of achieving good fortune.	3.25
An even more interesting image out of Chinese history is the walled village of Kat Hing Wai, in the village of Kam Tin just outside the market town of Yuen Long.	3.18

Guangzhou, with a population of more than 5 million, straddles the Pearl River — China’s fifth longest — which links the city to the South China Sea.	3.0
Guangzhou is interestingly one of China’s most prosperous cities, determinedly on the move into the modern world.	3.3
There are many package tours to Guangzhou from Hong Kong (see page 113), and this may be the easiest way to visit the city.	3.1
However, it’s also easy to get to Guangzhou by train or ferry.	3.2

Shenzhen was China’s first Special Economic Zone.	3.11
Visitors need a visa to enter China, and must disembark at the border (now called “boundary”) checkpoint, Lo Wai.	3.0
There are also souvenir stands, benches for a rest, and perhaps Hong Kong’s last surviving rickshaws — however these are not for rides, but are a tourist photo opportunity.	3.1
In Shekou is a large Free Market, and an exhibition of Xian’s terra-cotta warriors.	3.25
If you’re up to a climb, take the Mount Austin road to the Victoria Peak Gardens.	3.18
From the lower terminal of the Peak Tram it’s only a short walk to the former governor’s residence, Government House, now a museum.	3.1
You’ll find herb and medicine shops, incense shops, chop makers’ shops (makers of Chinese seals), and more.	3.1

Fall 2000	3.0
Dear Ms. LastName	3.12
Therefore when considering the indigenous revitalization movements which began in 20th century Latin America, the impact of those indigenous languages on those movements and the nature of the identity of the peoples themselves is key.	3.1
This question of identity as defined by language manifests differently in Guatemala and Colombia.	3.0
In contrast, Colombian indigenous groups are divided to the extent that linguistic diversity is not only valued, but serves to split the population, both between groups and within groups themselves.	3.0
Indigenous Revitalization Movements of Latin America: The Rediscovery of Language and Identity	3.1
The differences between cosmovision in Spanish and indigenous languages are great, leading to the difficulty of governing in Spanish yet embracing indigenous mode of thought.	3.0
In addition, there exists a complex relationship between what are perceived as different levels of indigenous identity; the Nasa, for example, divide themselves into the traditional, modern, and new.	3.0
The ONIC of Colombia lacks legitimacy precisely because it is perceived as not “Indian enough”; it embraces the use of Spanish and Western discourse, leading to distrust among indigenous peoples (Jackson 2002: 85).	2.7
Their struggle to attain status in societies still bearing the marks of Spanish colonialism is deeply tied to their struggle to reaffirm the nature of their “indigenous identity”, and is in turn linked to the interaction of Spanish and their native languages.	3.0
The Colombian constitution is problematic in that it provides little guide as to what exactly forms an indigenous group; the concept of culture is so complex and divergent that establishing self-determination in the eyes of the Colombian government requires emphasizing differences.	3.0
An emphasis on preserving, rather than practicing, native culture arises: indigenous authenticity is maintained by sustaining knowledge of traditional practices and beliefs without fully embracing them on a day-to-day basis (Gow and Rappaport 2002: 66-67).	3.0
In Guatemala, they are largely comprised of the conflict between poverty and progress; the pan-Mayan movement must meet the dual trials of establishing a positive identity within the Mayan population itself and legitimacy in the legal and political arenas in order to gain policy reforms and codified rights in law.	2.9
Humans, in the process of defining themselves, look to immediately recognizable factors in order to differentiate themselves from others.	2.89
In reality land ownership rights were the exclusive right of the Spanish, resulting in modern-day malappropriation of land ownership in the hands of the descendants of the Spanish colonialists (Warren 1978, 7-8). Indigenous peoples are commonly sharecroppers or migrant workers.	2.8
Guerrilla warfare has since become a part of Colombian life; multiple groups maintain an ongoing presence, often stationing themselves in the remote mountainous villages often populated by various indigenous peoples.	2.4
This is similar to the situation of Guatemala: the government felt it needed to battle communism, an “armed and dangerous menace within”, plunging the country into civil warfare in the 1960s and continuing through the 1980s (Warren 1993: 25).	2.9
The growth in popularity and militarism of these popular leftist movements is intertwined with the development of the indigenous revitalization movements.	2.8
It therefore often invokes the banner of indigenous rights in its own discourse .	2.91
A main concern among pan-Mayanists is the reversal of the long-seated inferiority complex of the Mayan people; despite their position as majority within the Guatemalan population, they remain impoverished and marginalized on the fridge of society.	2.86
One of the most dominant and easily noted factors is language.	3.0
It often stands in conflict with the AICO, its Guambiano counterpart (Jackson 2003: 83-84).	2.75
The Nasa and Guambiano have stood in opposition since pre-colonial times; therefore any coalition between the two advocacy groups is tenuous at best (Rappaport 2005: 2).	3.0
In the 1990s the rhetoric of "cultural diversity" was picked up the Colombian media, and subsequently entered the consciousness of the greater metropolitan public, thereby cementing its place in Colombian society as necessity and further complicating the role of indigenous movements in gaining rights for indigenous peoples as a whole.	2.7
While the repartimento was originally used to repress the indigenous groups, it is now used to support them: resguardos, or communally owned plots of land, are granted to communities.	3.5
Mayans gained formal recognition in 1995 as the majority population in a precursor to the 1996 peace accord; by 1999 its government floated a referendum on an indigenous bill of rights resembling that codified in the Colombian constitution (Warren 2002: 157-158).	3.27

The first evening, the twenty-something students--most from my college, four from another--gathered in the shrine room, sitting cross-legged on cushions as we listened to Khenpo Kalsang introduce Tibetan Buddhist philosophy.	3.08
We discussed the foundations: the Three Turnings of the Wheel of Dharma; the four noble truths; karma; defilements; the six perfections.	2.9

Ever since the 1920s, their science has been about observation of behavior, questionnaires, recordings of electrical brain activity.	3.0
All three examine the distinction between the self and others, between the observer and the observed, between knowing and the knower.	3.0
I agree with Ani Kunga to some extent--only so much can be known about the mind from external observation.	3.0
Tibetan Buddhist philosophy also approaches the mind and the self from the inside.	3.0
Compassion and anger were the session's topics.	3.0
"If there's something you can do, why are you unhappy?	2.7

If you believe self-control is malleable but limited, you'll set fewer goals.	2.73
They propose that people with high self-efficacy--people who believe that failure is the result of insufficient effort, and thus exhibit increased commitment and persistence--will achieve more of their goals than people with low self-efficacy, who tend to view failure as the result of deficient ability, and thus may simply give up.	3.0
The study was testing whether a belief in unlimited, malleable self-control would result in most resolutions, and indeed, this is what was found.	3.0
But if participants believed in unlimited self-control, self-efficacy had no effect; participants achieved just as many goals regardless, and people who set more resolutions were marginally more likely to succeed.	3.09
Mukhopadhyay & Venkatarmani realize that their research does not directly look at the relationship between lay theories of self-control and beliefs about one's own amount of self-control and self-efficacy, and propose this as an area for future study.	3.0

I smiled.	3.9
I didn't anticipate last night --"	3.1
"I am sorry,"	2.3
I waited in the dark, carpeted hall.	2.7
I heard no voices until Malaquez said, "Enter."	2.9
"Enter."	3.1
Her skin seemed as smooth and as polished as the bed's teak frame.	3.4
Though the morning sun shone fully on both of them, it shimmered around Tasha.	3.5
I threw a chair at him.	1.8
She did!	3.3
Now she will be."	2.9
Most of his story I have pieced together since, but I understood enough as I knelt on his chest with my hands tight on his fleshy throat.	2.44
He had made his name with a home capturador.	3.0
Most likely: she would be meat --there is a reason why stopboxes are most often used in kitchens.	2.9
Less likely: she would live the rest of her days with a mind as free of worry as a slug's.	3.12
And Tasha?	3.0
I could say that I chose out of consideration for her desire for fame; some critics already say "Waking With Tasha" is Malaquez's finest work.	3.2
If science finds a way to safely free the subjects of Emil's art, perhaps the I who reads this file will know that my decision is wise.	3.17
She said, "It's beautiful, isn't it, Señor Flynn?"	3.6
Her brows drew together, creasing the lovely, caramel-colored skin around her eyes and showing the pattern for an old woman's wrinkles on her forehead.	3.0
I laughed.	4.1
I clapped her shoulder to show I was not laughing at her.	3.1
"You will?"	3.11
"It amuses me.	3.8
Call me Bernardo."	3.25
"But of course!"	3.57
I remember Papa's stopbox, a teal blue Tiempo Capturado that Mama brought home for his birthday.	3.22
"I can fix that."	3.5
"You will?"	3.22
"I must.	2.9
All I could say was, "No.	2.5
It was huge and inefficient, and she should never have spent so many pesos on a toy, but Papa would not let her return it.	2.5
So it was as I wrote the preceding.	2.9
Apparently I was so successful that it lasted a week and a half.	3.29
Not bad for an eighty-three-year-old, even for one who has his rejuve every month.	3.25
Three!	3.29
He used it to preserve baby tomatoes, cucumbers, and strawberries in translucent cubes that he stored in the pantry for spring-time meals in the middle of winter.	3.1
I hope the wipe is as successful with my time on Vega IV as my spree was with my time here.	3.33
The issue of why I am evading the issue, or the issue itself?	2.7
The editor says no, only those that are relevant.	3.0
So today, I urge you to do these two things: FIRST: Sign the enclosed Citizens’ Advisory Ballot to show our Alaska allies your strong personal support to reinstate the ban on “same-day airborne land-and-shoot” wolf killing in Alaska; SECOND: Rush an urgent donation to help put this measure on the ballot and win passage in November.	2.8
“same-day airborne land-and-shoot”	3.0
The Alaska Legislature is completely out of step with the will of Alaska’s citizens and the American public at large.	2.5
And if history is any guide, over the years thousands of Alaska’s wolves will be brutally killed.	2.6
ALASKA EMERGENCY	2.0
So if we don’t act right now, Alaska’s snowy tundras will once again become bloody killing fields for wolves in America’s “Last Frontier.”	2.33
That’s why your special financial support is so important — and urgently needed.	3.11
Our well-funded opponents will spend whatever it takes to mislead and confuse voters about this ballot measure.	2.3
If Alaska’s new law is not replaced, thousands of Alaska's wolves will die in the years to come.	2.63
And it will be a major setback for wolves nationwide — at a time when the American public overwhelmingly favors wolf reintroduction and protection.	2.46
So, please don’t wait another minute.	2.89
1. SIGN the enclosed Citizens’ Advisory Ballot to show your support for repealing “same-day airborne land-and-shoot” wolf killing in Alaska;	2.78
In May the Alaska legislature voted to reinstate same-day airborne wolf killing.	2.9
And then, mail it back to us along with your emergency donation to help save Alaska’s wolves.	3.0
Sincerely, Rodger Schlickeisen President	3.1
So, please sign the enclosed Citizens’ Advisory Ballot to lend your moral support to our Alaska friends and return it in the enclosed envelope with a special donation.	3.14
Someone will need to begin by creating an urban "oasis" that mitigates some of the fears that you had while driving through the city -- where to buy groceries, a place where you can feel safe on your own front porch, the freedom to sleep soundly without worrying about your copper wiring.	3.09
"oasis"	3.5
3. For all that is wrong with Detroit -- and that's nearly everything -- you'd be astonished by the pride that Detroiters have for their city.	3.2
Raggedy Anarchy 21. Sep, 2009 at 7:21 pm	2.7
I've never been there, but ever since that mad, possessed American History Professor I had, I've been haunted by Detroit.	2.5
No, even before that -- The Dollmaker has often been called 'America's least pretentious masterpiece'.	3.0
Why, out in New Mexico, where you can still buy unincorporated land with no water or roads, you'd pay at least $1,000 for a house-sized plot of dust.	2.7
(Joyce Carol Oates in the NYTBR) When folks like Gertie Nevels, and Levon Helm and John Hiatt and my favorite, John Henry, left the mountains to go wrestle with the Industrial leviathan in Detroit, they were in it to the death.	3.1
Is this the greatness they built on earth?	3.1
This, American Glory?	2.63
This is the final phase, the crowning glory of America's greatness?	2.9
Does this show our system's superiority over the commies in China?	2.9
Do we still have fertile backyard gardens, filled with the composting of the age?	2.8
"Yuan"	3.1
"Free"	3.6
Are American lives well spent in thei "Middle East" endevor?	2.8
"Middle East"	3.1
I think not!	2.5
Jessica Reeder 22. Oct, 2009 at 3:36 pm	3.0
Just so we're clear on that.	3.1
I don't think you present a fully-informed argument on the causes of urban decay, but I don't disagree with you.	2.9
That's where the green movement comes in, and when I say "green" I'm talking plants not politics.	3.37
I pictured young artists owning homes, fixing up neighborhoods.	3.1
I agree -- Democrats, like country music, have disappointed me too many times in the past for me to keep on listening.	2.3
Just ask the Palestinians who left after the first war to cry over the past.	2.4
*Or even Friend Salmon, who still haunts my dreams and tells me not to let us blow each other's asses off the earth until we clean up the mess we have made.	2.4
*That was for Lumpy.	3.1
There is now a house for $10 listed on realtor.com	3.2
We could take that oil-stained soil and those rusted factories, and create something new and beautiful.	3.5
I plan to take a (Daytime) tour of these decaying areas especially the old factories.	2.8
However, the main reason I wanted to post was to say to "Lumpy", "the democrats have the unmidas touch", LMAO, that is classic.	3.5
and I must agree with Lumpy.	3.1
Thanks Lump-man.	3.18
BTW, great blog and great info.	4.0
Additionally, even if you paid cash for the house, you'd probably want to carry some homeowner's insurance with all the inherent risks to the property (arson, vandalism), and I'm sure it's sky-high, given those risks.	2.45
With houses going for $100, I thought, what would you have to lose by moving to Detroit?	3.1
Even in the center of the business district, there's no traffic and hardly any people.	3.45
Chief among these is Detroit, Motor City.	3.1
Don't believe me?	2.7
In fact, I've never felt so out of place in all my life .	2.0
Detroit is a ghost town, and it's inhabited by ghosts: the only people left here are those who can't or won't leave.	2.4
On one corner, we saw a giant banner hung across a charred front porch.	2.8
Buy a $100 house in Detroit, and you get a lifetime supply of sleepless nights: you'll spend the next several years waiting for burglars and arsonists, murderers and crackheads to break in the windows.	2.7
It's like the Wild West without the scenery, the gold, and the hope.	2.7
It's the Rust Belt.	3.0
Ultimately, I do believe that change will come to Detroit.	3.1
Truth is, any artist-type who moves into this part of Detroit is probably pretty handy with a pistol or a shotgun .	2.9
The movie wraps up by observing this, how abandoned buildings and spaces are being reclaimed by nature.	3.2
There are neighborhoods that refuse to cave.	3.18
(west of Livernois around McNichols).	3.0
$1,900!	3.3
Next time you're in Detroit, please head over.	3.4
In fact, the article went on, soon a nearby house went on the market for $100.	3.1
Think about that for a moment, hoes and shovels don't have enough pawn value to be worth carrying out.	2.9
Myself -- Thanks for the comment and the great information.	3.9
The artist types notified their buddies, who moved in post haste.	3.1
Love the fact that people are stealing garden implements (though it's still sad that they need to).	3.0
And when I'm in the area again, I'll go out to Belle Isle and think long&hard about the future of American cities--as I'm sure you do occasionally too.	3.0
1. Driving a Honda in Detroit right now probably isn't really going to get you welcomed with open arms.	2.67
See, there's a wee bit of loyalty to the Big 3 and driving a foreign car doesn't really scream "solidarity" to those struggling to survive.	2.7
A place.	3.0
Let me show you the rest.	3.0
'm a linguistics researcher, Ed.	3.0
Easter Island?	3.1
He pulled a sheet of folded paper from his pocket and handed it to me.	3.1
He pointed to a row that read, "Deep Storage: Fort Knox, KY."	2.9
I hadn't seen him since high-school, maybe twenty years before, and we were never buddies in the first place.	3.0
Deep Storage: Fort Knox, Ky.	2.89
I thought they didn't keep gold there anymore, just nerve gas.	2.9
How's your um... business?	2.86
"None," I said and slipped the knife into his neck right at the base of his skull.	2.1
None	2.78
All that gold in Fort Knox was just too much for me to wrap my head around.	2.71
I slipped the little pouch over my back and wiped the knife on his jacket.	2.89
I worried for just a moment when I started waving my hands.	2.5
What if it didn't work?	2.78
The gold was heavy on my back, and I was all the way to the car before I realized I had left the keys on Charles.	2.57
And I still wonder why Charles picked me?	2.8
Maybe he didn't know anybody else with "connections."	2.87
But mostly, I'm wondering what will happen when I try to make those gestures, that "device" right here in my cell?	2.8
But if I do make it, it won't matter what I tell you, because there won't be a jail that can hold me.	2.8
Charlie Boy had been working hard lately, I figured.	3.0
I knew every cop in Fairport and quite a few of the state police in Iowa, and I couldn't see them bringing old Charles in as a ringer.	3.0
He sighed and went on in softer, sadder voice, "I guess I'm a thief now."	2.14
Hold it.	3.0
I looked around.	3.0
Right.	3.2
That's alot.	3.0
He drained the last of his cup and tossed some bills on the table.	3.0
We took his rental car back to the motel where he was staying.	3.0
The little desk was covered with large books filled with sticky notes, a pile of folders and papers and a laptop computer plugged into the phone line.	3.0
He mostly read creation stories off objects like the 'Santiago Staff' which said things like, 'All the birds copulated with fish: There issued forth the sun.	3.0
It was those clues that started all of this.	3.0
I didn't see much money in hieroglyphic porn.	3.0
He talked on about people with long ears who built the big statues, the "moai" and people with short ears who conquered the people with long ears and ate them and how the short eared people didn't really know the secrets of the long ears and had pulled down all the moai statues and destroyed some of the tablets.	2.8
I was there early.	3.2
He pulled out a small leather diary and opened it to a yellowed page marked with yet another small sticky note.	3.0
I didn't see much resemblance except maybe there were about the same number of points in the cat's cradle thing in the diary and the number of dots on the map showing places where statues stood in a thin line around the coast of the island.	3.0
I was confused enough I let the "G word" slip.	2.6
The drive was shorter than I expected.	3.2
He was wearing a new jacket and snow boots, but he had on a Hawaiian shirt underneath and khaki shorts of all things.	2.89
This is it	3.18
I casually slid a knife into my palm just in case.	2.36
His tan was obviously deep and old, but it looked like a work tan, not the kind you get at the beach.	3.0
Device?	3.0
It's like sleight of hand.	3.1
Remember to reverse the two parts when you actually do it.	3.0
"Mnemonic." I muttered, which seemed to please him.	3.3
They help in remembering steps in a ritual or ceremonial gestures.	3.0
Now you do it.	2.89
I wanted to slug him, but he had the keys to the car back and I figured I'd humor him while I figured out how to get them without violating my parole.	2.1
We receive no government funding.	3.0
“As a boy in Bosnia, I walked my dog.	3.1
“After I got my beautiful black Lab, I finally felt like a human being again.	3.5
A world I thought I would never have again.”	3.0
People love dogs.	4.0
It costs over $20,000 to breed, care for and train a guide dog like “Duke” and to train his blind teammate.	3.0
It’s people like you who make it possible to give the priceless gift of “Second Sight” .	3.7
I slowly returned my attention to the conversation and was pleasantly surprised to find that it had turned to a heated analysis of a recent abstract film—done in the style of old flatscreen movies—that I had seen during off-time at Geminia Station.	3.0
I would join the rest of the ship for meals, and I would take my turn in the weight room.	3.11
I did not ask questions.	2.86
But I fell under the ship's sway.	2.9
Bereft of my previous familiar life, I latched onto Kishori and Ray and Zheng, and Sarah with Alexis dragged along on her arm now and then (he was mostly her favorite dancing partner; she confided to us one night that his conversational skills left something to be desired).	3.0
(The 'South' was in the title to suggest that there were more ballrooms.	3.0
Sarah's circle had picked up another newcomer, Adrienne, a short blond girl who we all agreed was barely old enough to attend a traditional university back on Earth, let alone work on the ship in whose wreck Jefferson had found her.	2.8
“We can't live that long.”	2.5
“Maybe the universe will end sooner than you think,” said Jefferson.	2.3
Yeah, the captain was there, with the rest of us.	3.1
Tiffany, she nodded eagerly.	3.36
Even if we were traveling at ninety-nine percent of the speed of light—that's assuming you ignore science and pretend that such a thing is possible, because it isn't—we'd still age.	3.0
We'd just appear to age slower than people not traveling as fast as us.”	3.12
Give our ancestors purpose.	3.0
Keep their dreams alive.”	3.14
“New hypothesis,” suggested Kishori, slipping into the conversation.	3.0
“No one's immortal.	2.6
Ray took a drink from his glass of ice water, and shook his head.	2.62
Tiffany took a drink, thinking.	3.14
Zheng looked skeptical.	2.75
“Smuggling,” responded Kishori.	2.88
“Think about it,”	3.1
“We're revolting,”	2.37
Did you hear what the captain said earlier?	3.0
“That's dumb,”	2.13
“That's dumb,” said Sarah.	2.29
“The captain selected us for a reason.	3.3
“I still like my idea,”	3.56
“I still like my idea,” said Tiffany.	3.38
I guess we all figured, he knew what he was doing.	3.1
Second, I was floating in the dark remnants of my broken ship, and any conceivable light sources were not within view; starlight is a distinctly different color and significantly less bright.	2.4
We aren't giving anyone purpose.	2.0
We're not even going to leave a legacy.	2.33
All we're doing is eating and drinking and shitting, breathing and fucking and nothing important, ever.	2.6
“You can't hold on forever, even if you don't ever, ever want to forget. How long until the memories slip away? How long until all you remember is this, the ship, the thick red carpeting, the chandeliers, the empty conversations you hold with the other shells who used to be people? When your life, the reason you lived, the people and faces and places, the emotions you felt, who and what you loved, when all that is gone, faded, what will you have left?”	2.4
Emily emily em-ill-ee em-i-lee eh-mill-ee eh-mih-lee.	3.1
We aren't angels.	2.67
We're just dumb and lucky.”	3.1
Traveling on this ship.”	3.27
Ray, he looked down at his hands, folded together in his lap, fingers interlaced.	2.82
Ray shrugged, then got up and left.	2.6
“What's your theory?”	3.25
“A couple weeks, I guess.	3.0
Maybe a month or two.”	2.9
She took a sip of her drink, plain water because, she had explained earlier, she had never liked the taste of alcohol, then fixed her gaze on me.	3.0
“I'm going to figure it out,” she said.	3.1
I'll figure it out, then I'm going to find a way home.”	2.86
The more I thought about it, the less sense the ship made.	3.0
I had spent weeks asking nothing, contentedly getting nowhere.	3.0
Another circle of chairs and couches, another uncomfortable question.	2.71
The recycled air tasted sweet in my mouth, and all thoughts that crossed my mind were cheap metaphors about life-giving substances and how breathing was like sex, only better.	3.7
Zheng shook his head and picked up a handful of candied pecans from a little dish on the end table.	2.9
“Keep adding people long enough, regardless, you get more overall. A couple people staying in their rooms, even if you switch out the people, won't make a difference.”	3.0
Ray and Zheng exchanged another glance.	3.1
“I don't think so.”	2.7
Sarah looked indignant.	2.6
“Of course we notice. But... well, no one important ever disappears, so it doesn't really matter, does it.”	2.8
No one contradicted her.	2.9
The scales had tipped.	2.86
From the looks on my companions' faces, I knew they were thinking the same.	3.0
“and so was Tiffany.”	2.9
“Why not?”	3.0
“Why are you so interested?”	3.11
“I don't want to be here forever.”	2.25
“Remember? Alexis left.”	2.9
Alexis left.”	2.9
“Disappeared,”	2.9
he asked.	3.0
The lightscreen had proved singularly unhelpful.	2.4
I inspected the arrays of entertainment options—abstract, old-style flatscreens, engrossing VR flicks and action games, a selection of quondam bestsellers and a few recently released novels hoping to gain popularity.	3.1
Furniture (dark wood, expensive, polished, no secret compartments), clothes, leftover tray of half-consumed food from the previous day's lunch, toiletries (complete with miniature bottles of sweet-smelling apricot honey lotion), lightscreen, me.	3.0
I wanted my contentment back.	2.8
I cornered Adrienne at dinner that night.	2.9
“Tell me,” I said, after we sat, “what you have found.”	3.0
It wasn't a question.	2.7
“I want to know.”	3.0
“I don't know much,” she said, still annoyed but at least cooperative.	2.44
She reviewed the information gleaned from our previous dinner conversations, adding, “I heard the captain say something yesterday, as I walking to the Pyrope Parlor.	3.0
And listen, when they came round the corner, Ray was with the captain.”	3.1
asked Adrienne.	3.0
It was a lie, but we needed information.	2.7
The survivors of the unfortunate accidents, the catastrophic malfunctions, the fateful crashes: this is us.	2.33
I shrugged.	2.5
“That doesn't answer my question,” she said.	2.4
asked Kishori sympathetically.	3.0
“At least have a drink,”	3.1
“I find it takes the edge off.”	3.1
“She doesn't drink, remember?”	3.0
“You ever heard of Dunbar?	2.91
“You ever heard of Dunbar? Well, we've got the perfect-size group right here.”	3.5
“If you dislike this place so much, why don't you do something about it?”	2.38
“What would we do?”	3.0
If he refuses, threaten him.	2.44
Black and more black, speckled by tiny points of light that flared up to break the emptiness, if only for a brief time.	3.0
That was tonight's melodramatic theme: the ephemeral nature of life.	3.0
Everything temporary.	3.0
This is our Hotel California.	3.0
And all of us, we were permanent characters in each others' stories.	3.14
“Some nights,”	3.0
Adrienne looked at me, then back out through the window.	3.12
“You don't see a meaning because there is no meaning,”	2.56
I couldn't find her.	2.11
Fact: Sound is a vibration.	3.1
I didn't want to be harvested.	2.0
Life boats, I thought.	2.78
I'd put on a space suit, I'd get out of this ship, I'd find civilization again.	3.0
“What about my crewmates? Why didn't you save them?”	2.4
A planet.	3.0
A space station.	3.0
“Relax,” he told me, sliding a needle into my arm.	2.4
It passed.	3.0
This is my Hotel California.	3.0
Quiet and peaceful, right?	3.57
“Couldn't,”	2.5
The occasional painting hung on the wall (generic landscapes and portraits of old people no one has ever met, primarily).	3.0
“Where are we going?”	3.0
I asked.	3.0
She gave me a look, pitying and a little pleased that she got to be the one to share the news.	3.0
“Honey,” she said, “You're going to be delighted.	4.11
Destination nowhere.”	3.0
I died in those last moments, suffocating on my own exhaled breath, and this, this was my reward.	2.3
It took me a couple days to realize I was, in fact, still alive.	3.2
I swore, if I ever had to see a photo of him in a skimpy bathing suit again, giving the camera a cheesy thumbs-up from a lounge chair on one of those white sandy beaches, I'd kiss a monkey.	2.7
The lightscreen provided had informed me when and where official meals were taking place, but I hadn't bothered to acknowledge the invitations.	3.0
Man, was it good to be done with that stage.	3.7
It was time to find out what hell looked like.	2.4
Cliques form in any decent-sized group of people.	2.9
Me, I was singled out by Sarah, an unassuming forty-something lady with a glass of champagne in one hand and the arm of a scrawny but tall blond man in the other.	3.0
She sidled up to me as I was scooping little round crackers and what appeared to be a baked cilantro cream dip onto a plate.	3.3
Fact: If, before all the air is sucked out of the ship, a person is so lucky to have stuffed him or herself into a space suit, that person has less than twenty-four hours to live.	2.6
I wondered if the food delivered to my quarters the past few days had been similarly amazing.	3.62
I looked longingly at the slices of cheddar olive bread as she whisked me over to the bar, but didn't protest.	2.6
The bar was manned by an expensive humanoid robot.	3.0
I categorized them based on their appearances, hoping I'd be able to pick them out of the crowd again later.	2.9
This is more than the person would have sans space suit.	2.9
Still others are less obvious but just as horrible; dogs fighting to the death for the benefit of blood thirsty gamblers; baby calves confined and malnourished to provide “milk-fed” veal for the gourmet; and the “accidental” drowning of porpoises in the nets of tuna fishermen.	1.88
And almost 6,000,000 companion pets are put to death in shelters throughout America.	2.25
Our primary goal, though, has always been to stop the cruel and inhumane treatment of animals before it happens, so we teach the public about the need to protect all animals from suffering, abuse and exploitation.	3.0
Today, we are placing special emphasis on pet adoption.	3.09
Your gift of at least $5 or $10 or even $15, will help The HSUS save millions of animals.	3.2
