5.	And with that, the UC San Diego chapter of my life is finished 🌊🎓✌🏼 One month ago, I graduated from UCSD and completed my BA in International Business with a minor in Japanese Studies. Thank you to my family and friends who’ve supported me throughout college and all the struggles that came with it. It’s been a long four years, and while it may have not ended in the way that I expected, I’m grateful for everything that has led up to my final quarter. Thank you to everyone who has followed me on this journey and congrats to my friends who also graduated this year 🥰🎉

15.	"Many of my movies have strong female leads- brave, self-sufficient girls that don't think twice about fighting for what they believe with all their heart. They'll need a friend, or a supporter, but never a savior. Any woman is just as capable of being a hero as any man." ~ Hayao Miyazaki ✌🏼🌸 #explorejapan

19. A great deal of your decisions are informed by your emotional responses because that is what emotions are designed to do: to appraise and summarize an experience and inform your actions. Hence, emotional intelligence is important in helping you become more aware of these emotional responses so that they don’t control you but rather you control them.

Got to know the team
Went over Heidi’s design doc and made sure that everyone’s onboard
Setup research TODOs for the summer and divided work

Before next meeting:
start with the TODOs 
Bella will draw the designs
let’s be critical; think about possible problems with the design (imagine that you are an investor and need to evaluate our idea)

Note: make sure not to post our idea publicly. It’s okay to ask friends for opinions since market research is important, but please ensure public confidentiality before we finish the app. Honestly, let’s just avoid talking about it until we have a meeting on market research.



Sep 10
6 members assembled
brainstorm



Sep 20
Hw2:
AuthorDao - delete: Heidi
AuthorDao - update: Jinhan 
BookDao - add, listAll, delete: Heidi
BookDao - update: Shravan
DBDaoCRUDTest - whoever writes the method
TestListAllAuthors, AllBooks - Sophia

Project:
Main Idea (draft) - Provide people with an “emotional hub” to express their thoughts and feelings and improve their general mental health
Basic Features: 
Content feeds
Content upload by users
Push content to users based on mood (how do we do that?)
Chat rooms
Send and receive messages
filter or recommend the chat rooms by: location, title (search?)
Mood/Emotion tagging (not a separate feature, applies to all content)
Everything should be ‘emotionally conscious’; take note of what mood the user is currently in and what they are looking for, and show them content and chats similar to what they want to see

Timeline:
Collecting comments before Tuesday. (Discussion on Thursday class?)
Make sure we are not trying to do too much (ask Darvish); narrow our focus to core components
@Lynn and @Bella start wireframing and try to finish basics by Friday (25th)


Sep 24

iteration 1 (prof’s note: SRS, list of user stories, implement feature(s) for one other user story):
write fake posts, build database with posts & tags
tags: target emotion, strength, topic
implement basic emotion selection and posting page


post recommendation algorithm


sentiment tagging algorithm for web-scraped data
find dataset
what library to use, dataset to use
iteration 2:
recommendation algorithm


Sep 27
hw3:
delete author route (server endpoint) and its test and possibly a delAuthorCascade test
Jinhan / Shraven

project:
name our app: 
to be decided
SRS
Heidi: add user stories
software
Java, Gradle, sparkJava, MongoDB, Heroku
HTML, CSS, Javascript
class diagram
Sophia (before 10/1)
User - userId, email, password, userName, colorEmotionsTableId, likedPosts<List>
Post - postId, userId(User), text, media<List>, emotionTags<List>, numComment, numLikes
Comment - commentId, userId(User), postId(Post)

Database(MongoDB) - URI, username, password
UserDao - Database
PostDao - Database
CommentDao - Database

Project Board
Jinhan: fill in ToDos

Wireframe
Color <-> emotions: after color selection, the user picks an emotion, and we record the color-emotion association so that they can only choose the color next time

TODO:
establish data structures
select emotion
make and see posts


Oct 1
Update SRS: 
Key function: track emotional status (?) 

Key question to consider:
how to detect people’s emotions and connect those to post contents
user selects “color of their day”
posts will be tagged with colors
tag manually to begin with; train a simple text-to-color model once we have enough data (1k maybe?)
user can correct the color of the posts they see
modify the user’s unique text-to-color model when they do so
how to show posts that a person choosing a specific color would like to see
if the user selects a negative color, show posts on the other side of the spectrum
otherwise, show some mix of positive (bright, by default) colors
avoid showing negative-colored (dark, by default) posts


Oct 4
Instead of using emotion-based, use intention-based (include “care for my emotion,” “cheer me up,” “make me calm,” etc)
if the user selects “care for my emotion” as intention / impact, let them choose an emotion, and make feeds based on their emotion
otherwise, make feeds based on their intention
tag for both intention and feeling
model for both intention and feeling?

Oct 8
intentions that we want to include
cheer me up, excite me -> exciting
chill, relax -> calm
inspire me, motivate me -> inspiring
make me laugh -> joke, funny meme
see opinions (may include negative posts)

care for my emotion -> user choose their emotion
skip (see all contents)

match the posts’ emotion tags with the intentions



predict emotions from posts
what emotions do we want?

Forums
discussion boards


Oct  11
homework 5
1: Sophia
2: Jinhan
3: Shravan + Bella
4: Heidi

Algorithm:
Tag posts with emotions; map emotion tags to user intentions

Deadline for finding a dataset
Wed, Oct 14


Oct 15
fix issues with iteration 1


Oct 18
See notes in the emotion study file

Oct 25
Hw6:
part1 postgres for Author (done) - Heidi
part1 postgres for Book - Shravan
part2 automated workflow - Jinhan

Project:
models
tags: both intentions and emotion tags, with an algorithm that associates emotions with intentions
Empty post blocks: “can you post something exciting” (or encouraging, etc)

Oct 29
TODO:
enhance security approaches

README: create a testing account (done) 
Landing page functionalities 
	diff post for diff intentions 
add feed link 
Post page front-end 
Aggregating constant feeds from external sources

consider: constantly getting posts?

Let tagging model run on another thread
socket programming
web workers?


Nov 1
TODOs:
Model compression? Do a simpler model?
Big problem: deployed Java app does not have Python interpreter or any python package (e.x. Tensorflow)
1. can we install python and the packages in Heroku environment?
yes, but then the app doesn’t know how to run (bc it should run as a Java app, which contains a .jar file)
2. Use Jython as the interpreter to run python commands; use pickle model so that no additional package needs to be installed
the same issue that we don’t know how to include .py files in java application .jar
3. another option: deploy the model and fetch from it
problem: the T5 models are too large to deploy
small T5 model
valence model accuracy: 18.2%; results look pretty good
arousal: 10.05%
dominance: 13.6%
